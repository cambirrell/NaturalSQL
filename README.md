### Description of Database
There is a database called "swims" maintained by USA Swimming which details all official races of the past maybe 20 years.
I thought I'd make and interact with a synthetic version of it. I make random people, teams, and meets. Each swimmer has a team. Each swim is connected to a person and a meet.
I populated with synthetic data with random dates and times and randomly picking from a list of names, meet names, and places.
